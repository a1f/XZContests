# XZContests

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexfetisov/XZContests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexfetisov/XZContests)

This is an open source project where we try to use the idea of CHelper.
We want to have cross-platform contest helper which could be used in different
online competitions.
